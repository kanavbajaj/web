          Brazil is the largest country in South America, spanning over half of
          the continent's land area. It shares borders with every South American
          country except Chile and Ecuador. Brazil's diverse geography includes
          the Amazon Rainforest, the world's largest tropical rainforest, which
          covers a significant portion of the country's northern region. The
          Amazon River, the world's largest river by discharge volume, flows
          through Brazil. The country also features other geographical landmarks
          such as the Pantanal, the world's largest tropical wetland area, and
          the Atlantic Forest, a biodiversity hotspot. Brazil has a long coastline
          along the Atlantic Ocean, with popular beach destinations like Rio de
          Janeiro and Salvador.
